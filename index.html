        My name is Chris Bascom its nice, thank you for coming to may page! It's pretty dificult answering questions about someone you don't even know isn't it? Well no problem, you are here and can now learn things about me! (I know a pretty good use of your time....) As I said before my name is Chris, now for the new stuff. I am 36 years old. I have some college experence, but not enough for a degree. I have achieve two seperate certifications. I have a personal training certification, and a TEFL certification. I did not end up using my personal training certification, but did spend time living abroad teaching english. I lived in Vietnam for 5.5 years. There I went to one of the colleges while i was there and studied Vietnamese. It was great living abroad and I would recommend it to anyone whom can get away for a bit. Being able to work remote is ideal, because having to show up to work everyday, makes it difficult to travel! Oh, incase your asked yes I'm addicted to energy drinks, and I'm not a big fan of seafood. :)
